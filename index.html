			<p>Hi, I'm Sam - currently an aspiring software developer at Tech Elevator's full stack Java bootcamp in Cleveland.</p>
			
			<p>I'm interested in expanding my two years of programming experience from a game development startup into a broader skillset. With this, I plan to tackle the dynamic challenges of a digital services organization and carry my interest for understanding human relationships down new avenues.</p>
			
			<p>I have degrees in Anthropology and Economics that developed from my fascination with how people behave and interact to form complex systems. At one point, I interned at the World Health Organization to help study how policy can shape behavior and improve lives, and that continues to be a personal passion regardless of context.</p>

			<p>When a friend proposed that I learn C# and partner with him on a passion project building a computer game in Unity3D, I saw it as a great opportunity learn a powerful new toolset in a fun and challenging way. It was a challenge that ultimately granted me valuable lessons in managing achievable goals and balancing group talents and interests, and I'm looking forward to bringing that experience with me to new projects and opportunities that help more people improve the way they live.</p>
