			<p>Hi, I'm Sam, currently an aspiring software developer at Tech Elevator's full stack Java bootcamp.</p>
			
			<p>I'm interested in expanding two years of programming experience from a game development startup into a broader skillset.  Thus armed, I will tackle the dynamic challenges of a digital organization and take my interests in understanding human relationships down new avenues.</p>
			
			<p>I have degrees in Anthropology and Economics that developed from my fascination with how people behave and interact to form complex systems. At one point, I interned at the World Health Organization to help study how policy can shape behavior and improve lives, and that continues as a driving passion of mine regardless of my context.</p>

			<p>When a friend proposed that I teach myself C# and partner with him on his a passion project, a computer game built in Unity3D, I saw it as a great opportunity learn a powerful new toolset in a fun and challenging way. It was a challenge that ultimately taught me valuable lessons in managing achievable goals and balancing group talents and interests, and I'm looking forward to bringing that experience with me to new projects and opportunities that help more people improve the way they live.</p>
